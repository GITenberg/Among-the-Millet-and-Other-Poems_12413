<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pale season, watcher in unvexed suspense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still priestess of the patient middle day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt wild March's humored petulence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the warm wooing of green kirtled May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maid month of sunny peace and sober grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weaver of flowers in sunward glades that ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With murmur of libation to the spring:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As memory of pain, all past, is peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joy, dream-tasted, hath the deepest cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So art thou sweetest of all months that lease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The twelve short spaces of the flying year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bloomless days are dead, and frozen fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more for many moons shall vex the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming of summer and fruit laden mirth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The grey song-sparrows full of spring have sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their clear thin silvery tunes in leafless trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The robin hops, and whistles, and among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silver-tasseled poplars the brown bees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmur faint dreams of summer harvestries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The creamy sun at even scatters down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gold-green mist across the murmuring town.<br /></span>
</div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By the slow streams the frogs all day and night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dream without thought of pain or heed of ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the long warm silent hours take flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever with soft throats that pulse and thrill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the pale-weeded shallows trill and trill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tremulous sweet voices, flute-like, answering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One to another glorying in the spring.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All day across the ever-cloven soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong horses labour, steaming in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the long furrows with slow straining toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning the brown clean layers; and one by one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crows gloom over them till daylight done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finds them asleep somewhere in dusk&egrave;d lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the wheatlands in the northern pines.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The old year's cloaking of brown leaves that bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forest floor-ways, plated close and true&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last love's labour of the autumn wind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is broken with curled flower buds white and blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the matted hollows, and speared through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thousand serpent-spotted blades up-sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet bloomless, of the slender adder-tongue.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the warm noon the south wind creeps and cools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the red-budded stems of maples throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still tangled etchings on the amber pools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite silent now, forgetful of the slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drip of the taps, the troughs, and trampled snow,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The keen March mornings, and the silvering rime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mirthful labour of the sugar prime.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, I have wandered with unwearied feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the long sweetness of an April day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lulled with cool murmurs and the drowsy beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of partridge wings in secret thickets grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The marriage hymns of all the birds at play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faces of sweet flowers, and easeful dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside slow reaches of frog-haunted streams;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wandered with happy feet, and quite forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shallow toil, the strife against the grain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near souls, that hear us call, but answer not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loneliness, perplexity and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high thoughts cankered with an earthly stain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the long draught emptied to the lees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turn me homeward in slow pacing ease,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cleaving the cedar shadows and the thin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mist of grey gnats that cloud the river shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet even choruses, that dance and spin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft tangles in the sunset; and once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city smites me with its dissonant roar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To its hot heart I pass, untroubled yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fed with calm hope, without desire or fret.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So to the year's first altar step I bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gifts of meek song, and make my spirit free<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With the blind working of unanxious spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless with her, whether the days that flee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale drouth or golden-fruited plenty see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that we toil, brothers, without distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In calm-eyed peace and godlike blamelessness.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One moment the slim cloudflakes seem to lean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their sad sunward faces aureoled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longing lips set downward brightening<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take the last sweet hand kiss of the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone down beyond the closing west acold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paying no reverence to the slender queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That like a curv&egrave;d olive leaf of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs low in heaven, rounded toward sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the small stars that one by one unfold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the gray border of the night begun.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Marching at ease. It was a radiant day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In February, the month of the great struggle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt sun and frost, when with advancing spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering golden vanguard of the spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds the broad winter's yet unbroken rear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In long-closed wavering contest. Thin pale threads<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Like streaks of ash across the far off blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were drawn, nor seemed to move. A brooding silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept all the land, a stillness as of sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the east the grey and motionless woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the great sun's fiery slow decline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew deep with gold. To westward all was silver.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hour had passed above me; I had reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loftiest level of the snow-piled fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear eyed, but unobservant, noting not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all the plain beneath me and the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took on a change of color splendid, gradual,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving no spot the same; nor that the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now like a fiery torrent overflamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great line of the west. Ere yet I turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With long stride homeward, being heated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the loose swinging motion, weary too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor uninclined to rest, a buried fence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose topmost log just shouldered from the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made me a seat, and thence with heated cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grazed by the northwind's edge of stinging ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked far out upon the snow-bound waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lifting hills and intersecting forests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scarce marked courses of the buried streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as I looked lost memory of the frost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transfixed with wonder, overborne with joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw them in their silence and their beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept by the sunset's rapid hand of fire,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wondrous and soft. Along the darkening east<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gold of all the forests slowly changed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To purple. In the valley far before me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low sunk in sapphire shadows, from its hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softer and lovelier than an opening flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uprose a city with its sun-touched towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bunch of amethysts.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Like one spell-bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught in the presence of some god, I stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor felt the keen wind and the deadly air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But watched the sun go down, and watched the gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fade from the town and the withdrawing hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their westward shapes athwart the dusky red<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Frail as a snow-white feather, forward put,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing sweet medicine for all distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth languor and unstrung forgetfulness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other held a little back for dread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One slender moonpale hand held forth to shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft slumber dripping from its pearly tip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into wide eyes; the other on her lip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in the watches of his sleepless care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cunning artist would have wrought her fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shy goddess, at keen seeking most afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet often coming, when we least have prayed.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="THE_ORGANIST" id="THE_ORGANIST"></a>THE ORGANIST.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">In his dim chapel day by day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The organist was wont to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And please himself with fluted reveries;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all the spirit's joy and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The longing of a tender life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took sound and form upon the ivory keys;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And though he seldom spoke a word,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The simple hearts that loved him heard<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His glowing soul in these.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">One day as he was wrapped, a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of feet stole near; he turned and found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little maid that stood beside him there.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She started, and in shrinking-wise<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Besought him with her liquid eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little features, very sweet and spare.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"You love the music, child," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And laid his hand upon her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And smoothed her matted hair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<span class="i1">She answered, "At the door one day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I sat and heard the organ play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did not dare to come inside for fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But yesterday, a little while,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I crept half up the empty aisle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the music sounding sweet and clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To-day I thought you would not mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For, master dear, your face was kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so I came up here."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"You love the music then," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And still he stroked her golden head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And followed out some winding reverie;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"And you are poor?" said he at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The maiden nodded, and he passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand across his forehead dreamingly;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"And will you be my friend?" he spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"And on the organ learn to make<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grand music here with me?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And all the little maiden's face<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was kindled with a grateful grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, master, teach me; I will slave for thee!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She cried; and so the child grew dear<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To him, and slowly year by year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He taught her all the organ's majesty;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And gave her from his slender store<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bread and warm clothing, that no more<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her cheeks were pinched to see.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
<span class="i1">And year by year the maiden grew<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Taller and lovelier, and the hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deepened upon her tender cheeks untried.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rounder, and queenlier, and more fair<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her form grew, and her golden hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell yearly richer at the master's side.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In speech and bearing, form and face,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sweeter and graver, grace by grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her beauties multiplied.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And sometimes at his work a glow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Would touch him, and he murmured low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How beautiful she is?" and bent his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And sometimes when the day went by<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And brought no maiden he would sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lean and listen for her velvet tread;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he would drop his hands and say,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"My music cometh not to-day;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pray God she be not dead!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">So the sweet maiden filled his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And with her growing grew his art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For day by day more wondrously he played.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such heavenly things the master wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That in his happy dreams he thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The organ's self did love the gold-haired maid:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But she, the maiden, never guessed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What prayers for her in hours of rest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sombre organ prayed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<span class="i1">At last, one summer morning fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The maiden came with braided hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took his hands, and held them eagerly.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"To-morrow is my wedding day;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dear master, bless me that the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life be smooth, not bitter unto me."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He stirred not; but the light did go<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Out of his shrunken cheeks, and oh!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His head hung heavily.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"You love him, then?" "I love him well,"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She answered, and a numbness fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his eyes and all his heart that bled.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A glory, half a smile, abode<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Within the maiden's eyes and glowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her parted lips. The master said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"God bless and bless thee, little maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With peace and long delight," and laid<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His hands upon her head.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And she was gone; and all that day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The hours crept up and slipped away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sat still, as moveless as a stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The night came down, with quiet stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And darkened him: in colored bars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the shadowy aisle the moonlight shone.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And then the master woke and passed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His hands across the keys at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And made the organ moan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<span class="i1">The organ shook, the music wept;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For sometimes like a wail it crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In broken moanings down the shadows drear;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And otherwhiles the sound did swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And like a sudden tempest fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the windows wonderful and clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The people gathered from the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And filled the chapel seat by seat&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They could not choose but hear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And there they sat till dawning light,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor ever stirred for awe. "To-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master hath a noble mood," they said.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But on a sudden ceased the sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like ghosts the people gathered round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the keys they found his fallen head.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The silent organ had received<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The master's broken heart relieved,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he was white and dead.<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder where Euktemon is to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euktemon with his rough and fitful talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His moody gesture and defiant stride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How strange, how bleak and unapproachable;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I liked him from the first. How soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know our friends, through all disguise of mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discerning by a subtle touch of spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The honest heart within. Euktemon's glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrayed him with it's gusty friendliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashing at moments from the clouded brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like brave warm sunshine, and his laughter too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rare, so sudden, so contagious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How at some merry scene, some well-told tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or swift invention of the wing&egrave;d wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It broke like thunderous water, rolling out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shaken peals on the delighted ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet no man would have dreamed, who saw us two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That first grey morning on the pier at Crete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That friendship could have forged thus easily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bond so subtle and so sure between us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, gloomy and austere; I, full of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he, yet in an adverse mood, at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting with lighter hands the lids of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untortured by its riddles; he, whose smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were rare and sudden as the autumn sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, to whom smiles are ever near the lip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I think he loved me too; my mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not unpleasant to him, though I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times I teased him with my flickering talk.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
<span class="i0">How self-immured he was; for all our converse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gathered little, little, of his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bitter trial to me, who love to learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The changes of men's outer circumstance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strokes that fate has shaped them with, and so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fitting to these their present speech and favour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discern the thought within. From him I gleaned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing. At the least word, however guarded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sought to try the fastenings of his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With prying hands, how mute and dark he grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like the cautious tortoise at a touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew in beneath his shell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">But ah, how sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The memory of that long untroubled day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me so joyous, and so free from care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spent as I love on foot, our first together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fate and the reluctant sea at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had given us safely to dry land; the tramp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From grey Mycen&aelig; by the pass to Corinth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smooth white road, the soft caressing air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of the scent of blossoms, the clear sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strewn lightly with the little tardy clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Helios' scattered flock, the low-branched oaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fountained resting-places, the cool nooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where eyes less darkened with life's use than mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance had caught the Naiads in their dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or won white glimpses of their flying heels.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How light our feet were: with what rhythmic strides<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We left the long blue gulf behind us, sown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far out with snowy sails; and how our hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose with the growth of morning, till we reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moss-hung fountain on the hillside near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleon&aelig;, where the dark anemones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cover the ground, and make it red like fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could ever grief, I wonder, or fixed care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or even the lingering twilight of old age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divest for me such memories of their sweet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even Euktemon's obdurate mood broke down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The odorous stillness, the serene bright air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leafy shadows, the warm blossoming earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew near with their voluptuous eloquence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And melted him. Ah, what a talk we had!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How eagerly our nimble tongues ran on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With link&egrave;d wit, in joyous sympathy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such hours, I think, are better than long years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brooding loneliness, mind touching mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leaping life, and thought sustaining thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till even the darkest chambers of grey time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ancient seats, and bolted mysteries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Open their hoary doors, and at a look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay all their treasures bare. How, when our thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wheeling on ever bolder wings at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew as it seemed too large for utterance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We both fell silent, striving to recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grasp such things as in our daring mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had but glimpsed and leaped at; yet how long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We studied thus with absent eyes, I know not;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Our thought died slowly out; the busy road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voices of the passers-by, the change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of garb and feature, and the various tongues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absorbed us. Ah, how clearly I recall them!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in these silent wakeful hours the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is strangely swift. With what sharp lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shapes of things that even years have buried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shine out upon the rapid memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving and warm like life. I can see now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The form of that tall peddler, whose strange wares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outlandish dialect and impudent gait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awoke Euktemon's laughter. In mine ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is echoing still the cracking string of gibes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They flung at one another. I remember too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grey-haired merchant with his bold black eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brace of slaves, the old ship captain tanned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweeping sea-winds and the pitiless sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But best of all that dainty amorous pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose youthful spirit neither heat nor toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could conquer. What a charming group they made?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The creaking litter and the long brown poles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sinewy bearers with their cat-like stride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dripping with sweat, that merry dark-eyed girl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sudden beauty shook us from our dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chained our eyes. How beautiful she was?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-hid among the gay Miletian cushions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lovely laughing face, the gracious form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fragrant lightly-knotted hair, and eyes<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Full of the dancing fire of wanton Corinth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That happy stripling, whose delighted feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swung at her side, whose tongue ran on so gaily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it for him alone she wreathes those smiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tunes so musically that flexile voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft as the Lydian flute? Surely his gait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaimed the lover, and his well-filled girdle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not less the lover's strength. How joyously<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strode, unmindful of his ruffled curls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose perfumes still went wide upon the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dust-stained robe unheeded, and the stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose ragged edges frayed his delicate shoes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How radiant, how full of hope he was!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What pleasant memories, how many things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose up again before me, as I lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-stretched among the crushed anemones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watched them, till a far off jutting ledge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Precluded sight, still listening till mine ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught the last vanishing murmur of their talk.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Only a little longer; then we rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With limbs refreshed, and kept a swinging pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward Corinth; but our talk, I know not why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell for that day. I wonder what there was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About those dainty lovers or their speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That changed Euktemon's mood; for all the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From high Cleon&aelig; to the city gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till sunset found us loitering without aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half lost among the dusky-moving crowds,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I could get nothing from him but dark looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short answers and the old defiant stride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some memory pricked him. It may be, perchance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman's treachery, some luckless passion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In former days endured, hath seared his blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dowered him with that cureless bitter humour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him solitude and the wanderer's life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone are sweet, the tumults of this world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thing unworthy of the wise man's touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its joys and sorrows to be met alike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With broad-browed scorn. One quality at least<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have in common; we are idlers both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shifters and wanderers through this sleepless world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Albeit in different moods. 'Tis that, I think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That knit us, and the universal need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For near companionship. Howe'er it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no hand that I would gladlier grasp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either on earth or in the nether gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the grey keel shall grind the Stygian strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than stern Euktemon's.<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
